Before actually running this example, the dependent projects need to be built or installed first.

- riscv-gnu-toolchain (with rvp support)
  - riscv-isa-sim (with rvp support)
- llvm (with rvp support)
- riscv-dlr (this repo)

Then modify these place:

In Makefile,
```
RISCV_INSTALL     := /path/to/riscv-gnu-toolchain/install #[TODO]
DLR_INSTALL       := /path/to/DLR-normal-build/install #[TODO]
DLR_RISCV_INSTALL := /path/to/DLR-riscv-build/install #[TODO]
LLVM_INSTALL      := /path/to/llvm-rvp/build #[TODO]
```

In host.cc,
```
// #[TODO]
#define DLR_DIR "/path/to/DLR/repo"
```
